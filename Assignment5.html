      <h2>London</h2>
      <p>London, city, capital of the United Kingdom. It is among the oldest of the world’s great cities—its history spanning
         nearly two millennia—and one of the most cosmopolitan. By far Britain’s largest metropolis, it is also the country’s 
         economic, transportation, and cultural centre.</p>

      <h2>Paris</h2>
      <p>Paris, city and capital of France, situated in the north-central part of the country. People were living on the site of
         the present-day city, located along the Seine River some 233 miles (375 km) upstream from the river’s mouth on the 
         English Channel (La Manche), by about 7600 BCE. The modern city has spread from the island (the Île de la Cité) and far 
         beyond both banks of the Seine.</p>
